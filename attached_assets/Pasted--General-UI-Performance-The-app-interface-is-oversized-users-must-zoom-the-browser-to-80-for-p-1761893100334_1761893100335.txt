. General UI & Performance

The app interface is oversized; users must zoom the browser to 80% for proper view.

Page transitions sometimes cause blank/white screens.

Overall navigation between pages (especially Tasks & Companies) feels slow.

Task sections are too wide, hiding part of the content on the left side.

When navigating back, some pages fail to reload properly (possible router/state issue).

2. Task Management (إدارة المهام)

Layout issue: Task board is too wide — left section partially hidden.

Blank screen: Opening task “Details” or “Edit” sometimes loads a white page.

Performance: Noticeable lag when multiple tasks are displayed.

Date validation: Tasks can be created with past dates.

Data sync: Tasks from personal profile or HR view not linked correctly to main Tasks.

Buttons: View/Edit icons occasionally cause blank pages.

Search: Global search only finds usernames — not task titles or descriptions.

3. Companies Module

Opening Files or Team tabs causes blank/white screens.

Returning from Files tab reloads the whole app.

After adding a company, clicking “View” leads to a blank screen.

Old dates accepted in fields without validation.

Sidebar lacks a Companies menu entry.

4. Chat & Calls

Calls and messages occasionally fail — audio/video buttons unresponsive.

No sound or visual notification for new messages on mobile.

Switching between chats can cause app freeze.

Group chats missing voice/video call buttons.

Reactions don’t show usernames of reactors.

Search within chat rooms doesn’t work.

Delete chat buttons nonfunctional in both group and private chats.

Group images visible in list but missing in header.

User avatars disappear daily (not persisted).

Can upload images but cannot paste copied images directly.

Clicking an image doesn’t open preview popup.

No recording timer — should show while recording.

Cannot edit existing group photo.

Clicking a reaction should open popup listing all users reacted.

5. Notifications

Clicking notifications doesn’t redirect to related page (chat/task/etc).

Notifications repeat multiple times for the same event.

Notifications not auto-marked as read when opening related content manually.

Notification counters update only when clicked.

Message sender receives notification for their own message (shouldn’t happen).

Browser notifications don’t work on mobile (iOS/Android).

Task notifications visible to creator incorrectly — should be visible only to “المكلف به” and “المراجع.”

Chrome notifications play sound repeatedly even if message is already seen.

6. Requests (الإجازات – السلف – الخصومات)

Leave Requests:

Submitting triggers 400 Bad Request.

Admin doesn’t receive it.

Approve/Decline actions fail (500 Internal Server Error).

Salary Advance (سلفة):

Request creation works but admin cannot approve/decline.

Deductions:

Creating deduction causes 500 Internal Server Error: حدث خطأ في إضافة الخصم.

UI & Accessibility:

Missing Edit/Delete buttons for requests.

Notifications appear but don’t open related request.

Export buttons under HR > Reports not working.

HR Employee view shows wrong user data.

No visible list of employees currently on leave after approval.

7. HR Panel & Admin Controls

“Add Employee” button doesn’t work (returns error).

Cannot delete or edit users.

No link between HR > Employee List and detailed profiles.

Reports/Payroll tables not aligned properly (need right alignment).

Add sorting and filtering to columns.

8. Suggestions Page (صفحة المقترحات)

Missing Edit and Delete options for submitted suggestions.

9. AI Models Page — Major Issues

Connection Problem:
When entering a valid OpenRouter API key and clicking “اتصال (Connect),” the app incorrectly returns an “Invalid API Key” error.

Missing Settings System:
There’s no dedicated settings page or popup for each AI model to manage:

API key input

Admin prompt setup

Model preferences and parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)

Model selection (from OpenRouter models list)

Functionality:

None of the AI models actually connect or generate responses (frontend only).

Clicking any model card still opens # links instead of real pages.

Reset Filters button doesn’t work.

Page layout inconsistent with the rest of the app (titles, icons too large).

Spinning transparent overlay icons should be removed.

Required Fix:
Fully integrate OpenRouter API to make all models functional, each with proper:

Working input/output chat interface.

Separate model settings popup.

Saved configuration per model.

Error handling for invalid keys, rate limits, or network issues.

Fetch and display available OpenRouter models dynamically.

10. Additional UI / UX Notes

Address field misaligned.

Allow moving cover photo vertically.

Add tooltips on unclear icons.

Export buttons don’t work across multiple pages.

Add validation to all forms.

Fix all backend API routes for /leaves, /deductions, /salary-advances, /tasks.

Stabilize notification system (sync, mobile/browser, repetition).

Fix call and chat features (connectivity, notifications, UI behavior).

Resolve AI integration — connect OpenRouter API and create full model settings UI.

Fix rendering issues (white screens, layout clipping).

Repair HR panel actions and ensure all requests are visible/approvable.

Add sidebar Companies menu for easier access.

Ensure full cross-page sync for tasks, notifications, and requests.
