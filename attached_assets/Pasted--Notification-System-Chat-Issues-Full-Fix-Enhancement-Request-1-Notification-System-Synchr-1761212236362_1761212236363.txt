ðŸ§© Notification System & Chat Issues â€” Full Fix & Enhancement Request

1. Notification System Synchronization




Problem:

The notification system across the entire app is not synchronized.




The header notification icon and dropdown menu donâ€™t update automatically unless the user clicks directly on a notification.




If a user opens a related message, task, or item manually (not via the notification), that notification remains unread in the header.




Notifications for the same event (e.g., receiving a new message) repeat multiple times â€” appearing in the browser repeatedly and triggering the sound multiple times even after being viewed.




Browser notifications are not working on mobile devices at all.




Required Fix:




Make the entire notification system fully synchronized across the app (header, dropdown, and browser).




Ensure that when a user opens any related item (chat, task, etc.) manually, its notification is marked as read and removed from unread lists.




Prevent repeated notifications and sounds â€” each notification should trigger only once per event.




Fix browser notification support on mobile devices.




2. Chat Features â€” Emojis, Stickers, and GIFs




Feature Request:




Add a full emoji picker, sticker support, and GIF sending to the chat interface.




Ensure messages containing these media types render correctly across desktop and mobile chat views.




3. Chat Link Colors




Issue:

Links sent inside chat messages currently appear in the primary color.

Required Fix:

Change link color in chat messages to white to match the chat color scheme.




4. Task Card User Info




Issue:

On the task card, it currently shows:




Ù…Ù†Ø´Ø¦ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù‡Ù…Ø© (Task Creator) and Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø±Ø§Ø¬Ø¹ (Reviewer).

But this is incorrect â€” it should display:




The user assigned to the task and the reviewerâ€™s name, not the creatorâ€™s name.




Required Fix:

Update the displayed user fields on the task card to show Assigned User + Reviewer correctly.




5. Chat Unread Count




Issue:

The unread message count (shown on the chat avatar icon) stays at 1 even after the user opens and reads the chat.

It only resets to 0 if the user sends a message back.




Required Fix:




Once the chat window is opened, all messages inside should be marked as read immediately.




The unread counter should update to 0 both in:

Make the entire notification system fully synchronized across the app (header, dropdow




The chat avatar icon, and




The notifications list in the header and its sections.
