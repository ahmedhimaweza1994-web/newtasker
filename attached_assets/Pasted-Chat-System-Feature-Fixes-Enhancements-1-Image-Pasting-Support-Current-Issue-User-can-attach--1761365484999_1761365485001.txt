Chat System — Feature Fixes & Enhancements
1. Image Pasting Support

Current Issue:
User can attach/upload an image manually, but cannot paste an image directly into the chat input (e.g., Ctrl+V from clipboard).

Required Fix:

Enable pasting images from clipboard directly into the chat.

When pasted, it should automatically preview the image before sending (similar to WhatsApp or Telegram behavior).

Once sent, it should be stored and displayed like any other uploaded image message.

2. Image Viewer Popup

Current Issue:
Images sent in chat appear only as thumbnails and cannot be enlarged.

Required Fix:

When the user clicks any image message, open it in a popup modal (lightbox) displaying the image in full size.

Modal should have:

Click outside to close

Zoom in/out and close buttons

Smooth transition animation

3. Voice Recording Timer

Current Issue:
During voice message recording, there is no timer visible to track duration.

Required Fix:

Add a live recording timer (mm:ss format) visible during recording.

Timer should start when recording begins and stop/reset when user stops recording.

Place the timer near the recording button with clean, minimal UI.

4. Chat Room Image Editing

Current Issue:
While creating a chat room, there’s an option to add a room image — but no way to edit it later.

Required Fix:

Add an Edit Room Image option on the room settings or info page.

Allow users with permission (admin/moderator) to:

Upload or change the current image

Remove image entirely (optional)

Ensure image preview and validation before saving.

Additional Requirement:

Allow adding images for common/public rooms (currently missing).

🤖 AI Menu — Redesigned Interactive Page
1. Current Issue

Currently, the “AI” menu item opens an external link.
This needs to be replaced with a dedicated in-app AI page.

2. New Page Structure

Create a new internal route/page for AI tools with an interactive, animated design.

Page Title: “AI Center” (or localized equivalent)

Main Elements:

Beautiful animated AI interface with interactive elements reacting to mouse hover.

A main AI character/face that shows facial expressions/emotions.

Consistent colors and design language with the main app UI.

Sections (AI Models):
Each model should be displayed as a clickable card/button with an animated icon:

🖼️ موديل انشاء الصور

🎬 موديل انشاء الفيديوهات

📈 موديل التسويق والسيو

✍️ موديل النصي

💻 موديل البرمجة

Each button/card will:

Have hover animation

Display the model name clearly

Redirect to # (temporary placeholder until actual model pages are built)

3. Technical Notes

Keep the design fully responsive (desktop & mobile).

Smooth hover/transition animations (can use Framer Motion or similar).

All icons should be vector-based and match app theme colors.

Future-ready structure — easy to link real model pages later.
