AI Page — Design Fixes & Full Interface Implementation
1. UI Alignment & Sizing Fixes

Current Issues:

The AI page title and subtitle text are too large compared to other pages in the app.

The brain icon at the top is oversized and misaligned with the layout.

Required Fixes:

Reduce title and subtitle font sizes to match the typography used on other main app pages.

Adjust alignment and spacing so the layout looks consistent with the rest of the app design.

Scale down the brain icon to a balanced size (visually proportional to the title).

Maintain responsive design and center alignment on all devices.

2. AI Model Cards — Remove Hover Effect

Current Issue:
Each AI model card currently shows a large transparent spinning icon on hover.

Required Fix:

Remove the spinning transparent icon completely.

Keep only the main static small icon for each model (the one already displayed on the card).

Maintain hover effects like glow or shadow if they exist, but no extra icons or overlays.

3. AI Models — Full Demo Interfaces

Current Issue:
Currently, all AI model cards link to # and have no interface or page.
We need to build full front-end demo interfaces for each model type.

4. New Requirement — Full Demo Interfaces

Each model card should open its own dedicated interactive page, simulating a real AI app experience — but front-end only (no backend or API calls yet).

Each interface should match modern AI app standards like ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, etc., with smooth UI/UX.

6. General UI/UX Requirements

All pages must match the app’s main design system (colors, typography, spacing, shadows).

Add smooth transitions between AI models (Framer Motion recommended).

Use animated AI icons that respond subtly to hover/mouse.

Ensure full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

All routes should be properly linked in the sidebar or main menu.

Prepare structure for future backend integration, keeping functions stubbed (no actual API calls yet).
