🧩 App Issues & Required Fixes
🗂️ 1. Companies Menu Integration

Add a new menu item for Companies in the sidebar navigation so users can access the Companies module directly.

🔔 2. Task Notifications Logic Fix

Current Issue:

All users currently receive notifications for new or updated tasks, including the task creator.

Required Behavior:

Only the following users should receive notifications related to a task:

المكلف به (Assigned User)

المراجع (Reviewer)

The creator of the task should not receive any notification unless they are also the assigned user (مكلف به).

The same filtering rule should apply to the task notification counter in the sidebar menu.

📩 3. Requests System (إجارات - سلفة - خصومات)

Several issues exist across different request types.

🟠 Leave Requests (إجارات)

Issue:

When creating a leave request, an error occurs:

POST /api/leaves 400 (Bad Request)


Fix:

Resolve backend and validation issues so leave requests are successfully submitted.

Ensure admins can receive, view, and approve/reject leave requests properly.

🔵 Loan Requests (سلفة)

Issue:

Request creation works, but when the admin clicks “Approve” or “Decline,” nothing happens.

Fix:

Ensure loan requests can be successfully updated (approved/rejected) by admin.

Trigger appropriate notifications upon status changes.

🔴 Deduction Requests (خصومات)

Issue:

Admin encounters multiple errors when creating a deduction request.

Fix:

Debug and fix all issues with deduction creation and update flow.

Confirm that all validations, database saves, and UI refreshes work correctly.

🧭 4. Task Page Layout Problem (Arabic Description)

في صفحة المهام، جزء كبير من المحتوى في ناحية الشمال مش بيبقى باين لأن الصفحة عريضة جدًا، وده بيخلي بعض التفاصيل والبيانات تختفي.

English for the AI developer:

The Tasks page layout has horizontal overflow issues — part of the content (especially on the left side) gets cut off or hidden because the page width is too large.

Fix the responsive layout so all task details and UI elements are fully visible across all screen sizes.

📱 5. Mobile Browser Notifications

Issue:

Push notifications work correctly inside the app, but browser notifications on mobile devices (iPhone and Android) do not appear at all.

Fix:

Investigate and fix mobile browser notification support (service workers, permissions, or HTTPS restrictions).

Ensure that notifications work seamlessly across all platforms (desktop & mobile browsers, as well as in-app).

✅ Final Goal:
All listed issues must be fully debugged and tested to ensure stable functionality across desktop and mobile environments — with no broken features, layout problems, or missing notifications.
