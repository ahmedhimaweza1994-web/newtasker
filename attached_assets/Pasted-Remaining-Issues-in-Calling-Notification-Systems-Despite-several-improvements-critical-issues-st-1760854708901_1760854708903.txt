Remaining Issues in Calling & Notification Systems

Despite several improvements, critical issues still persist in the calling and notification systems.
These must be fully fixed to make the app behave like a proper modern messaging platform.

üìû 1. Calling System ‚Äì Still Not Functioning Correctly

Although the previous technical errors are resolved, the core functionality is still broken.

‚ùå Current Problems:

When a user initiates a call, the recipient never receives any call signal or popup.

There is no incoming call notification, ringtone, or accept/decline dialog ‚Äî nothing shows up for the other user.

This indicates a possible WebRTC connection issue, missing event broadcast, or socket communication problem preventing the call signal from reaching the other user.

‚úÖ Tasks:

Diagnose and fix why call events (incoming, ringing, accepted) are not delivered between users.

Ensure the call triggers a visible popup + ringtone for the recipient ‚Äî no matter which page they are on.

Once the recipient accepts, open the existing call management popup with full features (mute, end, video toggle, etc.).

Verify that calls work end-to-end across multiple users and sessions.

Test both voice and video calls for reliability and synchronization.

üîî 2. Notification System ‚Äì Still Has Major Issues

The notification logic is still malfunctioning and must be fully corrected.

‚ùå Current Problems:

Clicking any notification (message, task, call, etc.) does nothing ‚Äî it does not open the relevant page.

Unread counters (badges) are not updated after viewing or opening notifications.

Example: after reading a message, the counter in the header/side panel still shows as unread.

Self-notification bug:

When a user sends a message, they also receive a notification for their own action, which should not happen.

Users should only get notifications triggered by others, not by themselves.

‚úÖ Tasks:

Fix navigation so clicking any notification automatically redirects to:

Message ‚Üí specific chat

Task ‚Üí related task page

Call ‚Üí call screen or relevant chat

Ensure unread counters update instantly and globally across:

Header

Sidebar

Notification dropdown/list

When a notification is viewed, mark it as read immediately and remove the count.

Prevent self-notifications ‚Äî only trigger alerts for incoming messages or actions from other users.

Confirm the notification system works consistently across all pages, reloads, and browser tabs.

üéØ Final Goal

The objective is to make both the Calling and Notification systems:

Fully real-time, synchronized, and cross-page functional.

Behave exactly like WhatsApp, Messenger, or Telegram, with:

Reliable call signaling and answering system.

Properly interactive, sound-enabled, and context-aware notifications.

Accurate unread counters that sync instantly.

No self-notifications or false triggers.

Everything must work seamlessly and consistently across the entire application.
