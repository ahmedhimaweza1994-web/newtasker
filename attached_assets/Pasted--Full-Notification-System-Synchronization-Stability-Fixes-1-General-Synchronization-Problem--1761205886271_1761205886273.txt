ðŸ”” Full Notification System â€” Synchronization & Stability Fixes
1. General Synchronization Problem (Across the Entire App)

Issue:
The current notification system is not synchronized properly across the entire app.
Notifications shown in the header menu and icon donâ€™t update in real-time when users view messages, tasks, or calls directly.

Required Fix:

Make sure all notification states are fully synchronized across the app (header menu, browser notifications, in-app popups, etc.).

When a user views or opens a message/task/call manually, its related notification should instantly be marked as read and removed from the unread list.

Notification counters (badges and header counts) must update in real-time using WebSocket or the appâ€™s current real-time system.

2. Repeated Notifications & Sound Alerts

Issue:
When someone sends a message, the receiver gets repeated notifications and sounds multiple times for the same message â€” even after reading it.
This creates constant popups and sound alerts instead of just one per new event.

Required Fix:

Ensure each notification (message, task, or call) triggers only once per event.

Prevent duplicated notifications from being sent repeatedly.

Once the user reads the message or views the related content, stop any further alerts for that event.

Make sure notification sounds play only once per message, not repeatedly.

Possible Cause:
This issue might be related to WebSocket misconfiguration or event duplication. Diagnose and fix it to ensure notifications are triggered correctly once per action.

3. Mobile Browser Notifications Not Working

Issue:
Push/browser notifications are not working on mobile devices (Android or iOS browsers).

Required Fix:

Diagnose and fix the mobile browser push notification setup.

Ensure proper service worker registration for push notifications on mobile.

Implement proper permission prompts and fallback for unsupported browsers.

Test and confirm notifications work smoothly on Chrome (Android) and Safari (iOS).

4. Overall Enhancement Goals

Ensure notifications update and sync instantly across all devices and browsers.

Guarantee real-time, one-time alerts with proper sound and visual indicators.

Make sure clicking any notification opens its corresponding page (chat, task, call, etc.).

Confirm mobile and desktop notifications behave the same way.

Optimize socket or event system for efficiency and no duplication.

âœ… Final Deliverables:

Fully synchronized notification system across all app sections.

One-time, real-time notifications with correct sounds.

Working push notifications for both desktop and mobile browsers.

Full testing and debugging for any socket or backend event duplication.
