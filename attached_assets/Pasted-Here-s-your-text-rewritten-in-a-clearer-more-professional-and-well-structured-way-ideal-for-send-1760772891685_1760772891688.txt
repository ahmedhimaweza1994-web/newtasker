Here’s your text rewritten in a clearer, more professional, and well-structured way — ideal for sending to a developer or project manager:

### **App Issues and Required Fixes**

The application currently has several issues that need to be addressed and improved:

---

#### **1. Chat Notifications**

* The chat feature does not send notifications like other parts of the app. When a user sends a message, the recipient receives no alert.
* We need to ensure that **all messages and app activities** trigger proper notifications.
* When a user clicks a message notification from the notifications section, it should **open the relevant chat and message directly**.
* The app should also support **browser notifications**, so users get alerts even when they are not on the app tab.
* The browser should prompt users to **allow notifications**, similar to other modern web apps.

---

#### **2. Chat Call Function**

* The **call feature in chat is not working properly**.
* When one user initiates a call, it shows as “calling,” but the recipient does not receive any call or notification.
* This feature needs to be fixed to ensure **calls work reliably and both users receive proper call alerts**.

---

#### **3. Profile Pictures in Chat**

* Users’ **profile pictures are not appearing** in the chat.
* When sending a message, it currently shows only the **initials of the user’s name** instead of their assigned profile image.
* We need to ensure that **profile images are displayed consistently across the entire app**, including chat.

---

#### **4. Group Chat Images**

* Add a new feature allowing users to **assign a group image** to each chat group created.
* The assigned image should **appear in the chat list**, replacing the group name initials.

---

#### **5. Tasks Page Improvements**

1. **Task Details View:**

   * Add a **view (eye) icon** for each task.
   * When clicked, it should display all task details — including **name, description, assigned users, comments**, etc.
   * Include an **Edit button** that allows the user to update the task details and save the changes.

2. **Duplicate Task Issue:**

   * Currently, when a user creates a task and assigns it to another user, the system **creates two separate tasks** (one for the creator and one for the assignee).
   * This needs to be changed so that the task is **created only once**.
   * The task should display **both users’ names (creator and assignee)** on the same entry instead of duplicating it.

Would you like me to format this as a **developer task list / bug report** (with bullet points and technical notes), or as a **formal document/report** to send to management?
